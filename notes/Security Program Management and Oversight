## Security Program Management and Oversight

### Explain the importance of policies, procedures, and frameworks

#### Policies
Policies define strategic direction and security expectations. 
Examples:
* **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**: Acceptable use of organizational assets
* **Security Policy**: Security expectations across the organization
* **Password Policy**: Password creation and management rules
* **Remote Access Policy**: Secure use of remote connectivity
* **Data Classification Policy**: Categorizing and handling data based on sensitivity

#### Procedures
Tactical, step-by-step instructions for executing policies. Examples:
* User onboarding
* Backup processes
* Incident response workflows

#### Standards and Guidelines
* **Standards**: Mandatory rules (e.g., use AES-256 encryption)
* **Guidelines**: Best practices (recommended but not enforced)


### Describe risk management processes

#### Risk Assessment
1. Identify assets
2. Identify threats/vulnerabilities
3. Assess likelihood and impact
4. Determine overall risk (e.g., Risk = Likelihood x Impact)

#### Risk Responses
* **Avoidance**: Eliminate risk by changing plans
* **Transference**: Use third parties (e.g., insurance)
* **Mitigation**: Reduce likelihood/impact
* **Acceptance**: Acknowledge and tolerate the risk

#### Risk Register
Track identified risks, severity, and controls.


### Security Awareness and Training
* **Phishing simulations**: Train against email scams
* **Role-based training**: Job-specific security content
* **Policy reviews**: Ensure policy comprehension
* **Ongoing education**: Address evolving threats


### Auditing and Monitoring
* **Auditing**: Periodic checks for policy compliance (internal/external)
* **Monitoring**: Continuous log and alert surveillance for threats


### Compliance Requirements
* **Regulations**: Mandatory (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
* **Standards**: Voluntary best practices (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST)
* **Audits**: Validate compliance controls and enforcement


### Benchmarks and Frameworks
* **CIS Controls**: Prioritized security actions
* **NIST CSF**: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
* **ISO/IEC 27001**: ISMS framework
* **COBIT**: IT governance and management


### Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

#### BCP (Business Continuity Plan)
* Keep operations running during disruption

#### DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan)
* Restore IT systems after an outage

#### Metrics
* **RTO (Recovery Time Objective) **: Max acceptable downtime
* **RPO (Recovery Point Objective) **: Max acceptable data loss

#### Testing Methods
* **Tabletop exercise**: Scenario discussion
* **Simulation**: Test response mechanisms
* **Full-interruption test**: Complete shutdown (rare)
