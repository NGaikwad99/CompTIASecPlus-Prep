### Hardening Techniques
- Mobile devices: implement full-disk encryption and remote wipe; implement biometric authentication and/or MFA; apply regular OS, firware and/or app patches
- Workstations:  implement biometric authentication and/or MFA; apply regular OS, firware and/or app patches; restrict user permissions
- Switches and routers: apply regular OS, firware and/or app patches; restrict user permissions; change default passwords; apply ACLs to restrict traffic; disable unnecessary ports and services

### Tools
BitLocker - Windows - full volume encryption feature
FileVault - MacOS - provides an extra layer of security by keeping someone from decrypting or getting access to your data without entering your login password
System File Checker - Windows
Tripwire - Linux 

### EAP Variations
